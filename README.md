We all have some kind of criticism on @Hirunikaconnect for her verbal and action

BUT

She is the brave woman started protest in front of president‚Äôs house in mirihana in March which created the momentum for March 31st protest and gotagogama

The Worst Part is : The Water they use in the Water Canons are Mud Water. It was purely filled with Mud! 

Thats how Horrible the State &amp; the Forces treating the Protesters.

The people of Sri Lanka are really struggling. 

The economy has completely collapsed. 

No fuel. 

Food and medicine shortages. 

It's heartbreaking. 

I hope it improves soon üôè
